Hi, my name is Adina Scheinfeld.

I am a graduating Senior majoring in in Computer Science with a double minor in Math and Data Science.

Previously, I have completed two IT Application Development internships with CVS Health where I worked with a team to develop RPA bots.
I have also completed  a research internship with Microsoft where I collaborated on a big data research project to analyze the correlation between race/gender and the outcomes of police misconduct cases in NYC, Philadelphia, and Chicago. 
This semester, I am working as a teaching assistant for a Calculus II class. 

Next semester, I am hoping to begin a PhD program in either Data Science or Computer Science.
Specifically, I am interested in doing research in Data Science and Machine Learning.
I have applied to a number of PhD  programs, and I am waiting for responses.
Any advice on where to apply or how to strengthen my applications would be very much appreciated. 

One of my hobbies is exercising.
I am a figure skater, and besides skating, I enjoy any exercise that will improve my skating skills.
