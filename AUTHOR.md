Hi, my name is Adina Scheinfeld. I am a graduating Senior majoring in Computer Science with a double minor in Math and Data Science. Next semester, I am hoping to begin a PhD program in either Data Science or Computer Science. Specifically, I am interested in doing research in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I have applied to a number of PhD programs, and I am waiting for responses. Any advice on where to apply or how to strengthen my applications would be very much appreciated. Previously, I have completed two IT Application Development internships with CVS Health where I worked with a team to develop RPA bots. I have also completed a research internship with Microsoft where I collaborated on a big data research project to analyze the correlation between race/gender and the outcomes of police misconduct cases in NYC, Philadelphia, and Chicago. This semester, I am working as a teaching assistant for a Calculus II class.

One of my hobbies is figure skating. But besides skating, I enjoy any type of exercise that will improve my skating skills.
